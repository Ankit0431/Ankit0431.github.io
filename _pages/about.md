# 👋🏼 Hey, I'm Ankit Pande!

🎓 B.Tech. Computer Science at Shri Ramdeobaba College of Engineering and Management

🏆 CGPA: 10/10;  AI & ML Enthusiast

Welcome to my personal academic website! This is where I document my journey through technology, research, and problem-solving. I enjoy working on projects that combine AI, cloud computing, and automation to create meaningful solutions. Whether it's building deep learning models for image analysis, automating workflows with cloud technologies, or developing smart applications, I love finding ways to make technology work smarter.

## 🏗️ About Me  
I’m a software developer, AI researcher, and problem-solver, currently pursuing my B.Tech. in Computer Science. My work revolves around building intelligent systems for real-world applications, from financial analysis to automation and deep learning. I’ve worked on projects that predict stock trends using AI, segment rooftops for solar panel installations, and automate grading systems using OCR and machine learning.  

Beyond coding, I enjoy mentoring, exploring AI ethics, and participating in hackathons. I believe in using technology to drive innovation, and I’m always eager to experiment, learn, and push the boundaries of what’s possible. When I’m not deep into research or building something new, I appreciate the simple joys of life—whether it’s unwinding with a good book, enjoying some dark chocolate, or just spending time with a cat curled up nearby. :cat:

Here are some of the areas I focus on:  

- 🔍 Machine Learning & AI
- ☁️ Cloud Computing
- 📊 Data Science & Visualization
- 🏆 Hackathons & Competitions

## 🔬 Research & Innovation  
I am currently working on publishing two research papers in the fields of machine learning and AI. These papers focus on cutting-edge applications in sentiment analysis for financial predictions and deep learning-based edge detection. Once published, I will share more details here.  

In addition to my research, I have two patents published in my name:  

- **An Automated System for the Evaluation of Textual and Diagrammatic Answers** – AI-driven grading system using OCR, handwriting recognition, and NLP
*(Application No. 202421087294)*
- **A System and a Method for Smart Shopping** – Retail automation using RFID/NFC, smart shelves, and IoT-enabled carts 
*(Application No. 202421061141)*

You can find more details about my patents [here](https://iprsearch.ipindia.gov.in/PublicSearch/PublicationSearch/ApplicationStatus).
